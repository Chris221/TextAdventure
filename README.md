"Chris's Text Adventure"
==================

The game starts with naming your character. The character then appears in the starting city with few instructions other then adventuring around. The back-story is more of a mystery that your character can’t remember it.

The world has different environments that you engage as you travel. Cities, forests, towers, caves, mines and rivers are some of the different environments that you can engage in.

There are many entities that you will encounter. Some of which are shopkeepers, unimportant civilians, and monsters. There are wizards, dragons, goblins, demons, and guards, but these are only some of them. Where these monsters are found is left up to the user to find.

The user will be able to chop wood, cook food, mine ores, fish, attack monsters, open doors, eat food, sell and buy.

The game is meant to be an open world with a story line. Once the story is finished you will be given the option to restart or continue to play the same character. The general progression around the world adds to the character building skills and levels, which ultimately add to the ending. The ending will be a mystery but you will end with a fight scene or a battle.

The main character can’t die permanently, the can only be hurt to the point at which they faint and magically get woken up, healed, in a city.

There are other surprises that the player will experience as they play.
